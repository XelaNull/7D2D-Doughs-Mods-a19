**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet hides the Day and Time info from you in the UI.

Why?
- More "immersion" due to a cleaner UI
- More "immersion" as you will not have this info readily available to perfectly time events in advance.
- To more easily allow other mods to provide time info for you (adding watches/clocks/etc.)

**Tested on**:
| This Mod version | Game version | Note |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| v1.0.0 | alpha 19.2 b4 | Likely works with all 19+ versions |
