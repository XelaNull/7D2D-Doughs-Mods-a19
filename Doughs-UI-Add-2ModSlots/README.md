**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds 2 more mod slots for items BUT the "tiering" of the item still determines the mod slots available and the tiering was changed only for items with an existing tiering -> slots of
| Item tier | Mod Slots |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| 1,2,3,4,5,6 | 1,1,2,2,3,4 |

The tiering -> slots was changed to
| Item tier | Mod Slots |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| 1,2,3,4,5,6 | 8,8,8,8,8,8 |


However, in items.xml you can comment out the above setting and select this setting, which is more in line with the "vanilla" game
| Item tier | Mod Slots |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| 1,2,3,4,5,6 | 1,2,4,5,7,8 |

NOTE: For items with a different tiering -> slots, no changes were made.  Also: If an item has 0 mod slots in vanilla, it will still have 0 slots.
