  <!-- NOTE: LIKELY to use any of the extra slots, you have to expand each weapon/item using it
  as they are all hardcoded to use 6 slots, via this line:
  <passive_effect name="ModSlots" operation="base_set" value="1,1,2,2,3,4" tier="1,2,3,4,5,6"/>

  Likely easist just to update Tier 6 "value" to 8...but how to do that with XML mod as you can't just pop of a value
  and you cannot also read a balue, modify it, and put it back

  DEFAULT: 6
