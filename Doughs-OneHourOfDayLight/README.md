**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Note**
Apparently some other people have simiar modlets containing this functionality (and possibly more):
[Claymores Modlets](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/)

Also: for game version a19+: I recommed if you are looking for a very dark nighttime to also look into loading this modlet: [Doughs-Buff-Ambiance-DarkerNights](https://github.com/doughphunghus/Doughs-Buff-Ambiance-DarkerNights)

**Description:**
Adds additional options to the starting game UI to allow for 0 hours of daylight to 24
and other options in between.  Note: Original modlet was named for 1 hour daylight.
To make the mod a bit more accessible, I added more options :)

You can select these hours of daylight (the default vanilla game allows only 12, 14, 16, 18):

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, or 24

Note:
- 0 is "Perpetual Daytime Darkness" which *looks* mostly like Twilight/Moonlight during regular
daytime hours. Its still nighttime though as the game sees it (zombies run, etc)

- 1 is "Perpetual Daytime Darkness" all the time, except for 1 hour of actual daylight.
If you choose 1 hour of daylight, the "Day" begins at 21:00 and ends at Midnight.
This means you start the game at 7:00 and have no light for 14 more hours.  The
sun comes up and races across the sky. Barely enough time to run to another POI, let
alone clear it out.

- (The intermediate times are self explanatory)

- 23 is 23 hours of "Perpetual Daylight", 1 hour of Night time

- 24 is "Perpetual Daylight".  I don't know if blood moon hordes will even spawn.
Haven't tested as I don't plan to play with this setting, just providing it for completeness
