**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet makes the weather more challenging to deal with.
It makes the assumption that the apocalypse recently occurred and the air is very dirty.
The winds of nuclear annihilation have not calmed....or something like that.

It includes:
Lots of wind will make you want to want to be inside.
A very low chances of having "remotely nice" weather.
High chance of rain.
More variations in temperature, so clothing will matter more.

**Note**: The dense "smoke/sand/fog" particle effects are in every biome (even underwater) so if its too much
(visually or FPS wise) there are 2 override mods to this mod to lessen them.
If you choose to use one, load only one:

[Doughs-PunishingWeather-Effects-Medium](https://github.com/doughphunghus/Doughs-PunishingWeather-Effects-Medium)

**In addition** there is another mod you can add that makes it even more challenging.  The name
is from the xml file it modifies (weathersurvival.xml):
