**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This is an attempt to make changes to the vanilla sounds to make the game environment
more "diverse" or "immersive" by changing the pitch or allowed pitch ranges.  

This is *also* an attempt to come up with more "normal sounding" extra game sounds by
remixing common sounds heard in the game in order to make repetitive/common
actions have a little more variety and increase immersion.

If you hear a sound that's a little too "weird" let me know!
Please reference the item/action that causes the sound.

Other than the sound pitch changes, this mod adds extra "new" sounds to these additional items.
