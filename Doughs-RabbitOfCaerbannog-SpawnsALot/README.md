**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet is an override mod for [Doughs-RabbitOfCaerbannog](https://github.com/doughphunghus/Doughs-RabbitOfCaerbannog)
in order to make it spawn "more frequently" in game, if you want the additional challenge.  

It causes the rabbit to spawn anywhere animals can spawn (still a fairly low probability) and in some zombie groups. Highest spawn rate is in the Wasteland.

**Required modlet**:
Doughs-RabbitOfCaerbannog
