**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet is an override mod for [Doughs-RabbitOfCaerbannog](https://github.com/doughphunghus/Doughs-RabbitOfCaerbannog)
in order to make it spawn "more frequently" in game, if you want the additional challenge.  

It causes the rabbit to spawn anywhere animals can spawn (still a fairly low probability) and in some zombie groups. Highest spawn rate is in the Wasteland.

**Tested on**:

| Game version | This Mod version  | Note |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| alpha 19.2 b3 | v2.0.2 | Works.  Likely works with all 19+ versions. |
| alpha 19.1 b8 (stable) | v2.0.2 | Patched to remove warning on load. Spawn rates unchanged |
| alpha 19 b157 | v2.0.1 | Updated for a19. Added to more spawning groups. Likely works for all a19.x versions |
| alpha 18.4 b? | v1.0.x | Works based on user comments on forums |
| alpha 18.3 b4 | v1.0.x | Built for alpha 18.3 |
