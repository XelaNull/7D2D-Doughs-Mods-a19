**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds 2 extra damaging steel grenades (1 regular timed grenade, the other a contact grenade)/ These grenades can be very dangerous to use and cause block damage and destruction (earth -> wood -> stone -> metal, in that order of destructive potential), unlike vanilla grenades.  These are not as powerful as TNT.

The new items can be crafted or bought from traders.

**Tested on**:
| This Mod version | Game version | Note |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| v1.0.0 | alpha 19.2 b4 | Likely works with all 19+ versions |
