**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description**
This modlet adds slots for adding 5 additional recipe ingredients to make a
total of 10 ingredients.  This is for cases where modding the game has resulted
in >5 ingredients for a recipe.

**Details**: Normally recipes in the vanilla game do not have >5 ingredients but if
mods are added it's possible (either by design or accident) that recipes
could have >5 ingredients. Without this mod if a recipe has >5 ingredients you
*can still* craft the recipe but you will not be able to view any more than 5
ingredients. This modlet is the best workaround I can come up with to add more
ingredients (so you can see them) as I could not find a way to make the
ingredient list scrollable.

**Tested on**:

| Game version tested on | This Mod version | Note |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| alpha 18 b155 EXP, a19 b157 EXP | v2.0.1 | Likley works on all alpha 18+ and alpha 19+ |
